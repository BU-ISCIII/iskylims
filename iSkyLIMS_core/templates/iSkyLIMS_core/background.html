           Life-science laboratories make increasing use of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
            for studying bio- macromolecules and their interactions. <br>
            Array-based methods for measuring gene expression or protein-DNA interactions are being replaced
            by RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq. <br>
            Sequencing is generally performed by specialized facilities that have to keep track of sequencing requests,
            trace samples, ensure quality and make data available according to predefined privileges.<br>
            An integrated tool helps to troubleshoot problems, to maintain a high quality standard, to reduce time and costs. <br>
            Commercial and non-commercial tools called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management Systems)
            are available for this purpose.<br>
            However, they often come at prohibitive cost and/or lack the flexibility and scalability needed to adjust seamlessly to the frequently changing protocols employed. <br>
            In order to manage the flow of sequencing data produced at the Genomic Unit of the Institute of Health Carlos III, we developed iSkyLIMS.

                The first version of iSkyLIMS had been deployed in December 2017. Since then, more than 4000 samples sequenced on 170 flow cells have been re-runed and processed, to have historic information from the last years.<br>
                The use of SpaceLIMS led to a drastic reduction on time and human errors that takes to carry out primary and secondary data analyses.<br>
                Primary data analysis refers to de-multiplexing and conversion of BCL to FASTQ format.<br>
                SpaceLIMS automatically generates and launches the scripts needed for primary data analysis. Depending on read length and read mode (single read or paired end read),
                 primary data analysis is generally finished within a few hours after the last chemistry cycle.

                Results: iSkyLIMS runs automatically and limits direct human interaction mainly to administrative tasks. iSkyLIMS data-delivery procedures were standardized making it easier for biologists and analysts to navigate the data. Automation also helps saving time. The workflows are available through an API provided by the workflow management system. The parameters and input data are passed to the workflow engine that performs de-multiplexing, quality control, alignments, etc.
